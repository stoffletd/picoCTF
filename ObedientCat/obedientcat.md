# Obedient Cat
Obedient Cat is the first picoGYM practice challenge,therfore one should be able to complete it with ease. The challenge presents us with a file. As this is an introductionary challenge, the flag is written in plain text:

To view the flag, all you must do is read the text with a file viewer. A simple way to do this within a terminal is with the cat command functionality.

``` cat flag ```

``` picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_1a94e0f9} ```

While this first challenge was very simple, it serves as a good starting point for learning cybersecurity CTF challenges.
